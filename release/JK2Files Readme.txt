DATE RELEASED: September 8th, 2013


CREDITS: JK2:SE was created by mcmonkey as a modification of Raven's released JK2 source code.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Just copy the new 'jk2mp.exe' file and 'base' folder into your JK2/Gamedata folder
(Remember to backup the old one, just to be safe!)
-- Also copy over BugTrap.dll !
Note: included folder 'base' and file within are OPTIONAL. You do not need them, and they may conflict with other mods!


DESCRIPTION:
JK2SE is a modification of JK2's main code to just be all around better in various small ways - such as new color codes.
Note: in console type "/mc_blockrandom 1" (without quotes) if you have a seizure risk or just dislike the ^: random text
Note: in console type "/colors" for a list of colors or "/update" to check for a JK2:SE update
